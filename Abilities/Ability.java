/* Liam Cristescu
* 3.5.2023
* I decided to have a little bit of fun with this assignment, all of the implementation is the same, except now the motif
 * is Star Trek ships. The only this that has changed is that how each child of Ships.Ship (was Monster) how has two hp fields:
 * shields, and hull (because every starship needs some shielding). I realize i turned in the first phase of this assignemnt
 * as per the original instructions, I have gone back and retroactively changed this files, and can resubmit them upon
 * request.
 *  This is the Abilities.Ability Interface, and currently does not have any code associated with it*/
